## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the minor project titled "Interpretable Deep Learning Approach for Long Horizon Health Prognosis of a Li-ion Battery" accepted at IEEE INDICON 2023. The project aims to predict Electric Vehicle (EV) battery State of Health (SoH) using the Toyota Battery Dataset. We have employed various deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and a range of machine learning algorithms. Additionally, we've integrated Explainable AI techniques to elucidate the impact of each extracted feature, achieving successful predictions of the battery's SoH for up to the next 100 cycles.

## Key Features

- Prediction of EV battery SoH for long horizons using deep learning models.
- Utilization of LSTM, RNN, and various machine learning algorithms for model development.
